# Bifrost Developers Docs
> Comprehensive documentation for developers building with Bifrost protocol

**Bifrost Developers** takes an unopinionated approach to developer development. Instead of forcing you to adopt our tech stack of choice, we provide you with code snippets, guidance, references, samples, public projects contributed by the community, bounty that you can leverage into whichever framework/technical stack/project that you are using or building.

The included resources aim to provide you with everything you need to launch a proof of concept, minimal viable product or even completed product. Comes with additional tools, documentation, and tricks for building onchain.

Whether you're a hackathon participant or an ambitious entrepreneur looking to launch the next unicorn protocol, this monorepo is designed with you in mind.
