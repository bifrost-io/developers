## Integration

Depending on the integration requirements, a developer may or may not need to interact with Bifrost Parachain directly. Most of the time, developers can interact with Bifrost SLPx protocol contracts on many other chains. For example, Bifrost SLPx contracts are deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, BNB Chain, Moonbeam, Manta, Soneium, and so on.
